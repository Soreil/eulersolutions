Special Pythagorean triplet
Problem 9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

ANSWER:

Look for a primitive pythoagorean triplet where abc % 1000 = 0
The tripple for which this is true is (8, 15, 17), this is the third triple
Programmatically generating a list of triplets would be doable with Euclid's formula. I did not use any programming for this problem.
